% This script will save out a larger grid of shapes, to allow for
% parametric manipulation of the difficulty. 
% Saves about 2500 images

% This version allows for background color to be chosen - good for the
% scanner because black shows dust from projector (trying to match these
% parameters closely for behav experiment)

% This set is what we used for final fMRI experiment
% In this version there is a scaling factor of 0.80 applied to dimension 1, 
% this is because in an early pilot version we found that axis 1 was 
% slightly easier than axis 2, so the scaling is meant to equate them. 
% This turns out to be a slight overcorrection.
